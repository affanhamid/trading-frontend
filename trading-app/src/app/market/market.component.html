            The <span class="font-semibold">MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</span> is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            The <span class="font-semibold">RVI (Relative Vigor Index)</span> compares the closing price to the price range and provides a predictive indicator of market direction. It is often used in conjunction with the MACD to confirm trends and reversals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            The <span class="font-semibold">AO (Awesome Oscillator)</span> is a momentum indicator that uses the difference between the 34-period and 5-period simple moving averages of the bar’s midpoints (H+L)/2. It helps to identify market momentum and potential reversal points.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            Together, these indicators provide a comprehensive view of market trends and potential turning points, making them popular among traders for developing robust trading strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-3">
            <strong class="font-semibold">Trading Rules:</strong> The MACD and the RVI both must produce a bullish signal within 5 periods of each other to enter a long position. The AO must also be bullish to enter a long position. Conversely, if the MACD and the RVI produce a bearish signal within 5 periods of each other, and the AO produces a bearish signal, a short position should be entered.
